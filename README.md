### ProtoBuilder
## a 3D level builder plugin for Godot

ProtoBuilder is a 3D level builder plugin that allows the user to quickly place and remove any object within a scene, as long as it's a subclass of Node3D.

This project is still in a very early stage. It will be updated over time, but updates will be slow.
If you are going to use this plugin in your project, please note that this github repo contains a godot project, so you have to extract the plugin yourself for the time being. (This will be changed in the future!)
